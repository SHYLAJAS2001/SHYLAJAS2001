### Projects
#### 🩸 Blood Bank Management System
Developed a Blood Bank Management System to manage blood stock and donor details efficiently. The system, built with ASP.NET and MySQL, allows admins to add, update, view, and remove donor and hospital information. Key features include tracking blood units, managing donor details, and providing quick data retrieval. This project replaced manual processes with a digital system, improving accuracy and operational efficiency.  
**Technology stack**: Front End: ASP.NET Back End: MySQL

#### 💵 Comparative Analysis of Image Segmentation Techniques for Currency Images
Developed a Fake Currency Detection System using Python and OpenCV to identify counterfeit currency. The system employs image processing techniques like noise reduction and edge detection, utilizing filters such as Mean, Gaussian, and Median. The project enhances image clarity and segmentation accuracy, distinguishing genuine from fake notes by analyzing features and patterns.  
**Technology Stack**: Programming Language: Python Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib Environment: Jupyter Notebook

#### 🌾 Enhancing Agricultural Efficiency through Machine Learning and Image Processing: A Comprehensive Study
Implemented a machine learning-based system for precision agriculture, leveraging image processing techniques to predict soil methane levels and food calorie values. The system aids in crop selection and offers recommendations based on environmental factors like humidity, pH levels, temperature, and rainfall. Employed Python for backend development, integrating machine learning libraries for data analysis and prediction. Developed a user-friendly web interface for input and output interaction.  
**Technology Stack**: Backend: Python Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow Web Development: Flask, HTML/CSS Database: SQLite Tools: Git
